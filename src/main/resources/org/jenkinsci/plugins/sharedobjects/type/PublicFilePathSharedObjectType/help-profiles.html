        Give optionally profiles to restrict the usage of this object.<br/>
        Each value can contain string values separated with a semicolon (;). <br/>
        For example in the use case of a build pipeline, you can have an object with the value 'build;package;deploy'.
        <br/>
        Or you can have a first object for the value 'build;test'
        and another object defined by the same name with the value 'deploy'
        in order to have a different value for another context.
